# HVAC Tokenized Performance Contracting System

This repository contains a blockchain-based solution for Commercial HVAC performance contracting, enabling transparent, verifiable, and automated efficiency tracking and payments.

## Overview

The HVAC Tokenized Performance Contracting System digitizes and automates the entire building efficiency upgrade lifecycle using smart contracts. This creates a trustless system where building owners, HVAC contractors, and financiers can participate with confidence.

## Key Components

### System Registration Contract
- Records essential details about climate control equipment
- Stores building characteristics, HVAC specifications, and operational parameters
- Establishes digital identity for each system in the network

### Efficiency Baseline Contract
- Documents pre-improvement performance metrics
- Creates immutable record of energy consumption patterns
- Establishes the reference point for measuring future improvements

### Upgrade Verification Contract
- Validates implementation of efficiency improvements
- Connects with IoT sensors to verify physical changes
- Provides proof of upgrade completion and quality

### Savings Calculation Contract
- Determines payments based on actual efficiency gains
- Compares real-time performance against baseline
- Automatically initiates payments when efficiency thresholds are met
